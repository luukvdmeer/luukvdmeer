### Hi there 👋

🙍‍♂️ I am Lucas. I come from The Netherlands, where the people call me Luuk. This is not a nickname, but rather some semi-official kind of second name.. It's complicated. You can call me whatever you want!

🌐🕐 I am a doctoral researcher in geoinformatics who enjoys working with any kind of spatio-temporal data. My main interests are sustainable mobility, urban planning and human-centred street design. I write software using mainly R, Python and sometimes PostreSQL.

📬 Maybe you want to contact me. For example when you like my work and would like to collaborate. Or when you don't like it.. Or when you just want to chat. Anyway, don't hesitate to shoot me a message, for example on [LinkedIN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luuk-van-der-meer/) or [Mastodon](https://datasci.social/@lvdmeer).

Outside of research, there are also other things I like. For example, riding my bike 🚲, going out hiking 🏕️ and playing the guitar 🎸.
